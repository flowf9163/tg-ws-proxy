     * Stop is pressed, whatever the worker is still doing, while the shim goes
     * on refusing starts until that worker is reaped; lowering [running] on a
     * false answer would break the promise above and put a Start button in
     * front of a start the shim answers with "proxy is still stopping".  That
     * window is reachable from the notification shade: tapping Stop there
     * resumes [MainActivity], and `onResume` calls this.  A true answer carries
     * no such ambiguity — the shim refuses starts for exactly as long as it
     * says true.
     *
     * So leaving the running state stays the stop path's job: the worker's
     * report, or [ProxyService] once it can see no report is coming.  A state
     * stuck on true is not a dead end either — the button that stale state
     * shows is Stop, and taking it clears it.
